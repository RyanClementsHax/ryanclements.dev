## Callouts

<aside class="info">
  I realize that using GitHub as my CMS is a little odd, but wonderful people
  like you contribute improvements to my open source content all the time and I
  appreciate that. So by keeping things in GitHub, that can continue. (Note the
  edit link at the bottom of every post).

## Tasklist

- [ ] To do
- [x] Done

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Block code "fences"

```text
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++
}

console.log(foo(5))
```
